## Description

First console application built in C# (or ever, for that matter).  Allows a user to purchase croissants, challah and cream puffs from a bakery in New Jersey.  There's a BOGO deal on loaves of bread and half off your third pastry!  Screaming deals, no joke.  Utilizes multiple classes, static variables, a bevy of if/else statements, and a couple loops.
